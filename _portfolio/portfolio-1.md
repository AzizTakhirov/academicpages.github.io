title: "Large Eddy Simulations of turbulent flows"
excerpt: "Turbulence is the natural state of many flows. Despite its importance, the brute-force numerical simulation of many turbulent flows is still a challenge. This complexity arises due to a wide range of scales present in velocity and pressure fields in turbulence. Legacy codes play a central role in practical simulations of turbulent flows, but often times, a lot of the details of those codes are unknown to its current users.

As our understanding of the field grows and more accurate methods are developed, one challenge is incorporating these new advances into the old computing platforms.  My interest is in developing computationally efficient schemes that allow incorporating modern turbulence models into the existing turbulence and multiphysics codes.<br/><img src='/images/research1.jpg'>"
