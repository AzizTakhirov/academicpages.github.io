I am a postdoctoral associate in the Department of Mathematics and Statistical Sciences at the University of Alberta, Canada.

My research interest is numerical analysis of partial differential equations, speficifally, of those modelling
flow and magnetohydrodynamics problems. These problems are motivated by several industrial and natural
applications, and my main effort lies in developing practically implementable computational models along
with their mathematical theory
